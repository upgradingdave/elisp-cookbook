* Development Environment
  
** Unit Tests
   
   To run the `ert` test suite, first make sure you are in the
   project's root directory. In other words, `test` should be a
   subdirectory of cwd. 
  
   To run the tests interactively (from within emacs), use: 

#+begin_src elisp
(ert "ckbk*")
#+end_src
  
   To run them from commandline, use: 

#+begin_src sh
./test/run-tests.sh
#+end_src
